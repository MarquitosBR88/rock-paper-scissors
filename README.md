# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Project #
## The Project ##
This project is from The Odin Project and is about creating a rock,paper,scissors game using JavaScript.
## After Completing The Project ##
After completing the project I realized that this was harder than I thought, keeping track of your functions and variables and recalling them are a little bit confusing for a beginner like me, but I think the result after some headache was awesome and satisfying.\
I'm looking forward for the next projects!
